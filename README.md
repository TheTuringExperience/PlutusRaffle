# PlutusRaffle
A Plutus smart contract to implement a raffle

#### THINGS TO DO (hopefully before the end of the anthropocene):
- Fix the bug that makes it impossible to close the raffle if there haven't been any transactions (even after the closing time has been reached)
- Make a trace to be able to test quickly from the shell instead of going into the playground every time.
